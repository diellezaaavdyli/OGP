Present at this event were representatives of leading institutions, civil society, media and interested citizens.The purpose of the open debate, which will be organized in other major municipalities of Kosovo during March, is to consult with representatives of key state institutions, NGOs, and citizens on key topics: anti - corruption, digital governance, data openness and citizen participation in decision - making.As a result of discussions and workshops, the Action Plan 2022-2024 will be a product of this co - creation process.',
    'post-4-p2': 'Delvina Haxhijaha, from ODK, praised the government`s willingness to cooperate with civil society organizations, emphasizing the full support of civil society throughout the whole process.She emphasized that a key role in promoting government institutions in respecting law enforcement, and institutional commitments and reforms that strengthen participation and cooperation, belongs to civil society.Only by having the right and accurate information, citizens and civil society will have the opportunity to discuss and request accountability on government affairs, in order to cooperate, monitor and evaluate the activity of leading institutions, said Haxhijaha.',

    'post-4-p4': 'The Kosovo National Action Plan is a plan that fulfills the principles of the OGP, envisages concrete actions and broad results, and paves the way for cross-sectoral cooperation in decision-making. In the open discussion session of the debate, when discussing anti-corruption, the fact that Kosovo is one of the few countries that fully discloses the property, assets, income and debts of about 5000 public officials of the country was considered as an achievement. However, those present emphasized that despite developments to combat this phenomenon, corruption requires more work and dedication, and the OGP Kosovo membership process presents an opportunity to step up the efforts to combat this phenomenon.',
    'post-4-p5': 'Another aspect discussed during the debate was digital governance and openness of data towards increasing transparency by the leading institutions in the country. The participants agreed that open government data should be seen as a necessity that enables the government to adapt to the needs of its citizens and that they should be in formats easily accessible and understandable to interested stakeholders. However, it was deemed important to reduce the administrative barriers and remove bureaucratic barriers that would facilitate the activity of potential investors, economic operators, civil society and citizens as well. As a required need was stressed the professional administrative capacity building in order to use technology to provide various services even when applying for basic documents in online form.',
    'post-4-p6': 'In the last point of discussion on civic engagement, it was appreciated the fact that Kosovo ranks among the 50 countries with the highest rate of internet penetration and digital capabilities, as well as with a high rate of possession of smart phones.However, the fact that the voice of citizens and civil society in many cases is not sufficiently taken into account during consultations and public hearings was considered worrying.As a concrete example was highlighted the process of budget planning which, although oftentimes is an open process, no preliminary analysis was made on the needs of citizens or in many cases they were not considered during the planning.Therefore, it is important to increase coordination, cooperation, and inform the parties in real time on such developments.',
    'post-4-p7': 'The public consultation campaign that will be organized during March and April 2022 will serve to increase the involvement of all stakeholders in the OGP membership process and also to gather concrete proposals for activities that would be included in the National Action Plan of the Republic of Kosovo.',

Dhe nuk është gjithmonë e lehtë për të bërë këtë, sepse gjatë historisë, përparimi është nxitur gjithmonë nga qytetarët që kanë guximin të ngrenë zërin e tyre dhe të mendojnë jo vetëm atë që është aktuale, por çfarë mund të jetë e rëndësishme për të ardhmen, dhe që janë të gatshëm të punojnë për të sjellë ndryshimin që ata kërkojnë.”',

E para Republika e Kosovës do të përfitonte anëtarësim si shtet i pavarur në një mekanizëm ndërkombëtar që është edhe prioritet i Qeverisë së Kosovës. E dyta do të mundësonte zbatimin e parimit për transparencë radikale në qeverisjen e Qeverisë Kurti II. Do të strukturonte bashkëpunimin me organizatat e shoqërisë civile dhe sektorin e biznesit. Më e rëndësishmja është se qeverisja e hapur dhe transparente është parakusht për luftimin e korrupsionit brenda institucioneve publike. Me luftimin e korrupsionit vendi ynë bëhet vend atraktiv dhe i sigurt për investime private nga jashtë dhe brenda Kosovës. Më këtë anëtarësim Republika e Kosovës do të bëhet pjesë e vendeve me demokraci të zhvilluar e cila promovon qeverisje transparente dhe që do të ndikonte në reformimin dhe efikasitetin e shërbimeve publike”.

Mirëpo shqetësuese u konsiderua fakti që zëri i qytetarëve dhe shoqërisë civile në shumë raste nuk merret parasysh mjaftueshëm përgjatë konsultimeve dhe seancave publike. Si shembull konkret u theksua procesi i planifikimeve buxhetore të cilat edhe pse shpeshherë kanë qenë të hapura, nuk janë bërë analiza paraprake mbi nevojat e qytetarëve apo në shumë raste ato nuk janë konsideruar përgjatë planifikimit.

    'post-4-p3': 'Sa druge strane, Fidan Kaljaja, lider POU-a Kosova, istakao je da je proces javnih diskusija važan za uključivanje organizacija civilnog društva u vladina pitanja, a proces članstva u POU-u zahteva punu i kontinuiranu koordinaciju između vlade i organizacija civilnog društva. Međusobna saradnja će doprineti povećanju uključivanja i konsultacija svih zainteresovanih strana kroz diskusiju o izazovima, uspesima i davanjem konkretnih preporuka, koje će biti uključene u Nacionalnom akcionom planu Republike Kosovo.',
    'post-4-p4': 'Nacionalni akcioni plan Kosova je plan koji ispunjava principe POU-a, predviđa konkretne akcije i široke rezultate i utire put među-sektorskoj saradnji u donošenju odluka. U otvorenoj diskusiji debate, kada se raspravljalo o borbi protiv korupcije, dostignućem je ocenjena činjenica da je Kosovo jedna od retkih zemalja koja u potpunosti otkriva imovinu, imovinu, prihode i dugove oko 5000 javnih funkcionera zemlje. Međutim, prisutni su istakli da i pored dešavanja u borbi protiv ove pojave, korupcija zahteva više rada i posvećenosti, a proces članstva u POU Kosova predstavlja priliku da se pojačaju napori u borbi protiv ove pojave.',
    'post-4-p5': 'Drugi aspekt o kojem se razgovaralo tokom debate je digitalno upravljanje i otvorenost podataka prema povećanju transparentnosti od strane vodećih institucija u zemlji. Učesnici su se složili da otvorene vladine podatke treba posmatrati kao neophodnost koja omogućava vladi da se prilagodi potrebama svojih građana i da treba da budu u formatima koji su lako dostupni i razumljivi zainteresovanim stranama. Međutim, smatra se važnim smanjenje administrativnih barijera i uklanjanje birokratskih barijera koje bi olakšale aktivnost potencijalnih investitora, privrednih subjekata, civilnog društva i građana. Kao neophodna potreba naglašena je stručna izgradnja administrativnih kapaciteta kako bi se koristila tehnologija za pružanje različitih usluga čak i pri podnošenju osnovnih dokumenata u onlajn formi.',
    'post-4-p6': 'U poslednjoj tački diskusije o građanskom angažovanju, ceni se činjenica da se Kosovo svrstava među 50 zemalja sa najvećom stopom penetracije interneta i digitalnih mogućnosti, kao i sa visokom stopom posedovanja pametnih telefona. Međutim, zabrinjavajućom je ocenjena činjenica da se glas građana i civilnog društva u mnogim slučajevima nedovoljno uzima u obzir tokom konsultacija i javnih rasprava. Kao konkretan primer istaknut je proces planiranja budžeta koji, iako je često otvoren proces, nije rađena preliminarna analiza potreba građana ili u velikom broju slučajeva one nisu uzete u obzir prilikom planiranja. Stoga je važno povećati koordinaciju, saradnju i informisati strane u realnom vremenu o takvim dešavanjima.',
    'post-4-p7': 'Kampanja javnih konsultacija koja će biti organizovana tokom marta i aprila 2022. godine poslužiće za povećanje uključenosti svih zainteresovanih strana u proces članstva u POU-u, kao i za prikupljanje konkretnih predloga za aktivnosti koje bi bile uključene u Nacionalnom akcionom planu Republike Kosovo.',
